## Abstract

Healthcare is an organized provision of medical practices provided to individuals or a community. Over centuries the need for the application of healthcare has been needed increasingly as humans expand their life span and become more aware of better preventative care practices. The application of Big Data within the industry of Healthcare is of the utmost importance in order to quantify the effects of wide scale efficient and safe solutions. Pharmaceutical and Bio Data Research companies can use big data to intake large facets of patient record data and use this collected data to iterate how preventative care can be implemented before diseases actually present themselves in stages that are beyond the point of potential recovery. Data collected in laboratory settings and statistics collected from medical and state institutions of Healthcare facilitate time, money, and life saving initiatives as machine learning can in certain instances perform better than the average doctor at detecting malignant cells. Big data within healthcare has proven great results for the advancement and diverse application of informed reasoning towards medical solutions.

## 1.  Introduction

As modern technology continues to expand into every field of work it broadens the capabilities of each area of the field. Healthcare is one of those fields that greatly benefits from such applications.  Healthcare is a multi-dimensional system established with the sole aim for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of health-related issues or impairments in human beings[^7]. The many dimensions of Healthcare indicates the influx of information coming and going from each level as there are multiple different applications of Healthcare. This includes such things like dentistry, medicine, midwifery, nursing, psychology, physiotherapy, etc.  Big data plays a pivotal role when it comes to industries such as Healthcare because of the collection of information that needs to be digitized and maintained in an organized manner to draw relevant conclusions from the information. The demand for healthcare data is renowned around the world as medical professionals find the collective information of medical treatment necessary for moving forward with treatment every time so that they may perform and guarantee the safety and recovery of their patients.

## 2. Big Data in Examination Room

EHR stands for “electronic health records” and is a digital version of a patient’s paper chart.The Healthcare industry utilizes EHR for maintaining records of everything related in their institutions.  EHR are real-time, patient centred records that make information available instantly and securely to authorized users.[^11] EHR is capable of holding even more information as it is possible to include such information such as medical history, diagnoses, medications, treatment plans, immunization dates, allergies, radiology images, and laboratory and test results. According to Definitive Healthcare data from 2020, more than 89 percent of all hospitals have implemented inpatient or ambulatory EHR systems.[^8] A network of information surrounding a patient's health record and medical data allows for the research and production of such progressive advancement in treatment. EHR is an amazing asset to Healthcare but ultimately requires a hefty price tag for access as the data is quite pivotal and essential to the procedures of preventing and treating people around the world. That’s not to say that this information isn’t worth the price as it has become a game changer for medical professionals. As EHR data has been claimed to be the “ultimate” fund for the developments through clinical data mining, it encourages improvements in clinical practice and helps the comprehension of the genetics basis of disease. To underline the potential of the resources, more than 110 million EHRs around the continents were inspected for genetic disease research.[^2] This is the capability of EHRs as it withholds information capable of diagnosing, preventing and treating other patients for early detection of an ailment or disease. It is remarkable that the application can work so far ahead for preventive measures as well as the allocation of resources to make sure that patients are paying for the care at minimum costs because the correct staff and application of care is applied.  

## 3. EHR Application

### 3.1 Detecting Error and Reducing Costs

In order to understand the impact that Big Data such as EHRs has on the Healthcare industry an example of research is presented in the form of collection before and after implementation of EHR. The research study collected data for the period of 1 year before EHR (pre-EHR) and 1 year after EHR (post-EHR) implementation. What was noticed in the analyzes of the data was in the area of “Medication errors and near misses” the research stated “medication errors per 1000 hospital days decreased 14.0%-from 17.9% in the pre-EHR period to 15.4% in the 9 months after CPOE implementation”.[^1] The research determined that with implementation of EHR with (CPOE) computerized provider order entry was able to reduce the costs of treatment and improvised upon the safety of their patients. Participants of the study mentioned that there was an increase in speed when it came to pharmacy, laboratory and radiology orders. The research also stated “our study demonstrated an 18% reduction in laboratory testing.” The study touched upon the rapidness that EHR can add to a process of treatment when orders are validated much quicker and hospitals and patients save money from the rapid diagnosis and treatment. This cuts out the middle-man of deliberate testing and examinations upon patients so they don’t have to cover the costs or undergo wasteful testing from their own EHR and other extensive EHR that it utilizes for comparison. 

### 3.2 Review in Medical Application

Another individual case follows Dr. Linda Groene as a solo practitioner in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Dr. Groene practices internal medicine and geriatrics and treats a total of 340 patients at her clinic. Dr. Groene has been utilizing EHR since 2003 and she has made it a model for connecting quality treatment with health IT. Ever since the implementation of EHR in Dr. Groene’s practice has altered her work and the pace it has her treating patients. As a result of this implementation it is mentioned “number of workflow changes that contributed to improved planning for and follow-up after patient visits”.[^5] This adjustment allows her to have a preemptive diagnosis when patients themselves are entering the symptoms they have so she can be prepared for what to look for. Such readiness can improve the quality of treatment that patients are seeking when they seek treatment for their ailment. Dr. Groene writes down information of her own when it comes to collecting data over her patients for preventive care so that she can also accurately keep tabs on each and everyone of her own patients even with the assistance of EHR. Dr. Groene hopes to improve her laboratory tracking so that her staff can follow up with patients whose lab reports may or may have not been sent to her practice. Dr. Groene like many other medical professionals has experienced and benefitted from the utilization of EHR so that she may improve her practice for her sake and her patients sake. Quality assurance is always at stake if areas such as time, treatment and testing bother their patients so improvements in all these areas will eventually require all medical institutions to apply EHR use and tracking. Unless not everyone is on board with utilizing such an abundance of medical records.

## 4. Early Detection Big Data Applications

### 4.1 Early Detection

“An ounce of prevention is worth more than a pound of a cure” is a common philosophy held by medical professionals. The meaning behind this ideology is found in that if one can prevent a disease from ever taking its final form through performing small routine tasks and check ups, a plethora of harm and suffering from trying to recage a disease can be avoided. Many medical solutions for diseases such as cancer or degenerative brain diseases rely on the idea that outside medical intervention will strengthen the patient enough for the human body to heal itself through existing biological principles.[^4] For example, vaccines work by injecting dead cells into a patient so that its antibodies can be learned and immunity can be built up by white blood cells naturally. Intervening before one is infected must be completed for these measures to be effective. If preventative care such as routine screenings on individuals with family history of diseases or those with general genetic predispositions then the power truly lies in having the discernment knowledge to catch the disease early. In many diseases once a patient is presenting symptoms, it is too late or survival/recovery probability percentages are slashed. This places immense pressures on patients themselves to work to have access to routine screenings and even more pressure on physicians to intake these patients and make preliminary diagnosis with little more than a visual analysis of the patient. Big data automates these tasks and gives physicians an incredible advantage and discernment as to what is truly happening within a patient’s circumstance.

### 4.2 Detecting Cervical Cancer

Cervical cancer in the past was one of the most common causes of cancer death for women in the United States. However preventive care in the form of pap test has been able to drop the death rate significantly. In the pap test images are taken of the women’s cervix to identify any changes that might indicate cancer is going to form. Cervical cancer has a much higher death rate without early detection as a cure is easier to take full effect in the early stages.  Artificial Intelligence performs an algorithm and gives the computer the ability to act and reason based on a set of known information. Machine learning implements more data and allows the computer to work iteratively and make predictions and make decisions based on the massive amount of data provided. In this way, machines have had the ability to detect cervical cancer with greater precision and accuracy in some cases than gynecologists.[^12] This is ground breaking for women in underdeveloped countries like India and Nigeria where the death rate for cervical cancer is much higher than the United States due to lack of access to routine pap smears. Women could get results on their cervical cancer status even if they do not get a pap smear every 3 years as recommended by doctors. For example if a woman in Nigeria has her first pap smear at the age of 40 when the recommended age to start pap smears is 21 she has gone unchecked for nearly 20 years and the early detection window is narrowed. However, if she is one of the 20% of women who get cervical cancer over the age of 65, a deep learning analysis of her pap smear at 40 could save her life and roadblock potential suffering. Early detection is key and big data optimizes early detection windows by providing a deeper analysis in the preventive care stages. From here doctors are able to implement the best care plan available on a case by case basis. 

## 5. Possibilites

### 5.1 Further Uses

EHR as mentioned earlier is digitized health records of patients so that medical institutions can keep records of the treatment patients experience as well as any medical history that may be of any importance to their medical practitioners. EHR has continued to be utilized as it is still essential to keeping tabs on patients and being used as preventive measures for following up with patients or as references. These are all important uses but in order to make the most of these records for medical practitioners who must spend more time with the computer searching through records than their patients must connect the symptoms and make an estimated diagnosis with what they have available. Well as technology continues to improve so do the applications when it comes to maintaining Big Data like EHR. An article written by the Healthcare IT News covered the evolution of next-generation EHR to feature new innovations-such as the cloud, machine learning and mobility.[^9] This is necessary in order to reduce physician fatigue as they already have a workload that requires their attention constantly. 

* The cloud can reduce the total cost of ownership of IT while improving scalability and security.[^9] The costs of EHR is not a cheap object as sharing such information is costly when it comes to purchasing such essential information from EHR vendors.
* With machine learning, the IT learns what works best for a healthcare organization for maximum efficiency.[^9] Machine learning would allow for internalized information from interaction with patients and surface the information to continue to further comprehension of what is asked of it when it comes to relevant information for medical professionals and patients alike. This allows for physicians to relieve themselves researching through several files of EHR to find the most relevant piece of information. 
* Another aspect of improvement is mobility as it provides them what they need whenever and wherever the individual may be when in need of the information pertaining to their own medical records. 
* EHR records of several patients in a certain area might be able to assist with tracking down a disease’s effect on a certain demographic in a specific location. Hypothetically, if a number of patients from a city located near a steel mill with a population that is 92% African American has a rise in lung cancer diagnosis of patients aged 40 and above, accessing EHR records of these people could help draw legal help to gain justice for people who live near polluted air sources. Potentially records could be accessed by AI of younger patients in the area who are also African American to cross analyze a civilian of the area’s increased risk of lung cancer from residing there for a specific amount of years. 

### 5.2 Barriers to adoption of EHR System

In a study conducted in 2013 there was an investigation to learn as to why physicians are not adopting the use of EHRs in their practices. A table was established to demonstrate as to why physicians are unable to utilize EHR in their practice.

**Figure 1:**. Barriers Physicians Indicate [^3]

![Barriers Physicians Indicate](https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/fa20-523-352/raw/main/report/images/Barrier.JPEG)


Figure 1. Indicates the responses of the subjects as to why they’re unable to utilize EHR/EMRs.

This is quite an old study so this chart does indicate anything definitive but it has been registered as an actual study and only 7 years have passed when this study was conducted. There are some relevant points that can be applicable to how individual practitioners must handle their practice.
* Time
Physicians do not take the time to properly become familiar with the available products, select an EMR, implement it, and then train to use it even though colleagues have invested time and realized great benefit. [^3]
* Costs
It is understandable that costs may weigh heavily for individual physicians as they’re not able to afford the access to external vendors and other additional costs like IT will burden the physician.
* Absence of computer skills
In order to access EMRs which is digitized patient chart the need for computer skills is essential because physicians must go through extensive researching to find the file necessary unless upgrades are conducted so that machine learning aids in that process.

## 6. Discussion

Big Data in the Healthcare industry is centered around the collection and distribution of EHR for physicians across the world. In such challenging times when COVID-19 claims the lives of large quantities every day it is important that we reflect upon such moments in history when the lack of preparation can be fatal. Such lack of preparation can cost the lives of many especially when the spread of the illness spreads before any countermeasures can be implemented. EHR is a pivotal collection of data when it comes to diagnosing and treating patients while also cutting on the amount of time needed to treat them and the cost it will require the hospital for their services. EHR/EMR are the common form of retaining information for present and past ailments so that such a trend can be developed for preventive measures. It has been around since the 1960s and around 1965 it was already being utilized in 73 hospitals and clinical information projects by contributing to the collection of data.[^6] EHR has come a long way in the implementations of numerous practices as well as the means of improving each practice that utilizes it. There are still areas of improvement that require attention for it be such as: 

* GPS Technology and Real-time reminders and alerts for patients. [^10] This area is for the consideration of patients as they have every right to access their own medical records. Especially when any changes occur it is essential that patients have access and alerts of this because it will concern them or their families. 

* Adaptation of more unique EHR systems-less general as many healthcare facilities use a general EHR system that isn’t customized to suit the needs of their practice. [^10] This in turn then requires physicians to look more for the information that is needed. This barrier was mentioned earlier before and will continue being an issue until it comes to a resolution.

Otherwise the EHR is headed in a direction that will continue to solidify its usefulness in the Healthcare industry. As it is preparing to expand in areas necessary to become more friendly such as the cloud, machine learning and mobility. The only thing that is gonna be changing in terms of the structure of EHR is how vendors will have to deal with the ‘cloud’ as ownership of EHR will be much more available and not require as many costs for access. Such efforts should continue being made because a collective effort is made to improve and strengthen Healthcare will ultimately benefit those who work in that field and those who require Healthcare treatment.

## 7. Conclusion 

Healthcare is an essential resource to living a long life and without it we can see our lifespan slashed nearly in half or even more for those who are hindered by hereditary ailments. Healthcare has been around as long as medicine and such other treatments have been around and that was centuries ago. The field has expanded well beyond what could’ve been expected for any medical professional or institution. Where the information and resources are available to save and care for the life before them even when a lack of training can hinder them the resources are present. It's come to be such an accomplishment to mesh the medical practices of many medical professionals and Big Data to develop the largest compendium of medical practices in the world. By the allowance of such an asset many are able to collaborate with new findings and reinforcing old findings as these prevalent results allow physicians to work without faltering over inconclusive findings. The goal for this area of Big Data is to continue making the EHR system more secure and friendly towards medical professionals in different areas of practice as well as allowing easy access for patients who seek out their own medical history. The more advancements in this area of Healthcare can be applicable to other fields that must reference the compendium that maintains individuals and their history going forward. Such a structure will continue to aid generations of physicians and patients alike and can aid technological advancements along the way.
